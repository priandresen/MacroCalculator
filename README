MacroCalculator is a Java-based backend service built with Maven that implements logic for computing macronutrient and calorie recommendations. The project includes core application code, build tools, and container configuration so it can be run locally or deployed via Docker. It is intended to support the frontend by exposing endpoints for calculating personalized macro goals based on user inputs (e.g., weight, goals, activity)
